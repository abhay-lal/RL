## Reinforcement learning
•	Intro to RL
•	Intro to MDP
•	Q-Learning
 
## Components in RL:
1.	Agents
2.	Environment
3.	States
4.	Rewards – Win (+1), Loss (-1), Draw (0)

## Markov Decision Process:
Markov Reward Process – Applied to anything that is sequential in nature

## Value function: (Tells if we should transition from one state to another)
State – value
Action – value
## Optimal Value function:
Includes both state and action values to decide the best one.
Bellman Optimality Equation – Values and states satisfy recursive relations for any MDP
## Tasks in RL:
Episodic tasks
Continuous tasks

## Q-Learning:
Q represent how useful a given action is in gaining a reward. It is an off-policy algorithm. 

## Exploration Exploitation Tradeoff:
Greedy Action  
Non-Greedy Action
